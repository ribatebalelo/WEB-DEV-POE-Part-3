# HealthCare+ Website

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Doctors Appointment Website** that allows patients to book appointments, submit enquiries, and contact the clinic. The website includes **form validation**, **JavaScript enhancements**, and **SEO optimisation** to ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.

Forms are used to collect patient information and appointment details, validated using both HTML5 attributes and JavaScript before submission (W3C, 2023; W3Schools, 2025). AJAX submission improves responsiveness, while interactive elements such as modals, accordions, and dynamic search functionality enhance usability (Freeman and Robson, 2020; Duckett, 2014).

The website also follows best practices in **security**, **performance optimisation**, and **SEO**, including robots.txt, sitemap.xml, alt text for images, and responsive design for mobile devices (Chaffey, 2022; Moz, 2023).

## Features

### 1. JavaScript Form Validation

* **Client-Side Validation:** JavaScript ensures form data is checked before submission (W3Schools, 2025).
* **Error Handling:** Dynamic error messages guide users to correct invalid inputs (Freeman and Robson, 2020).
* **AJAX Submission:** Forms can be submitted without reloading the page, improving user experience (Duckett, 2014).

### 2. Contact & Appointment Forms

* **contact.html:** Collects patient details and messages, which are formatted into an email structure (W3C, 2023).
* **appointment.html:** Allows patients to request appointments, select doctors, and specify dates/times. Form inputs are validated for correctness (W3C, 2023; W3Schools, 2025).

### 3. Additional Website Features

* **robots.txt** and **sitemap.xml** guide search engines for better indexing (Moz, 2023).
* **Page Speed Optimisation:** Compressed images, caching, and reduced script blocking improve load times (Chaffey, 2022).
* **Security Measures:** Input sanitisation and HTTPS recommendations are implemented to protect user data (Freeman and Robson, 2020).

### 4. SEO Requirements

* **On-Page SEO:** Keyword integration, meta descriptions, structured header tags, alt text for images, and mobile-friendly design (Chaffey, 2022; Moz, 2023).
* **Off-Page SEO:** Backlink strategy, social media promotion, and local search optimisation (Moz, 2023).

### 5. JavaScript Enhancements

* Interactive UI elements (accordions, tabs, modals) to improve navigation (Freeman and Robson, 2020).
* Interactive map using **Leaflet.js** for location-based features (Duckett, 2014).
* Animations and transitions with JavaScript and CSS (Freeman and Robson, 2020).

## Change Log

### Part 3 – Current Updates

AJAX form submission was implemented to allow users to submit forms without refreshing the page, improving responsiveness (W3Schools, 2025). **robots.txt** and **sitemap.xml** files were added to improve SEO and guide search engines (Moz, 2023). Security measures including input sanitisation and HTTPS recommendations were applied (Freeman and Robson, 2020).

Interactive features such as accordions, modals, a gallery with lightbox, and an interactive map using Leaflet.js were added to enhance user engagement (Duckett, 2014; Freeman and Robson, 2020). A dynamic search function was implemented to allow patients to find doctors, services, or appointment slots efficiently (Duckett, 2014).

### Part 2 – Previous Updates

Form validation was improved with stricter JavaScript rules and inline error messages to enhance usability (W3Schools, 2025). The contact form was updated for accessibility, including ARIA attributes for screen readers (W3C, 2023). All changes were committed regularly with descriptive messages to maintain proper version control (Chaffey, 2022).
